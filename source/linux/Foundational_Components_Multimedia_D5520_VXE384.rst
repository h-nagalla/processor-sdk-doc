Introduction
============

TI's embedded processors such as |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| have the
following hardware accelerators:

     #.  Multi-Standard HD Video Decoder (DECODER) based on D5520MP2 from
         Imagination Technologies for accelerating multimedia decode
     #.  Multi-Standard HD Video Encoder (ENCODER) based on VXE384MP2 from
         Imagination Technologies for accelerating multimedia encode

In order to make it easy for customers to write applications, and to
leverage open source elements that provide functionality such as AVI
stream demuxing, audio encode/decode, etc, TI's |__SDK_FULL_NAME__|
provides ARM-based GStreamer plugins that abstract the hardware
acceleration.

.. rubric:: Capabilities of DECODER, ENCODER, and ARM
   :name: capabilities-of-decoder-encoder-and-arm

In |__SDK_FULL_NAME__|, DECODER supports the following codecs:

        -  Video Decode: H.264 and HEVC/H.265
        -  Image Decode: MJPEG

In |__SDK_FULL_NAME__|, ENCODER supports the following codecs:

        -  Video Encode: H.264

Demo applications also demonstrate the following ARM-based coding
capabilities:

        -  Audio encoding and decoding on ARM: AAC, MPEG2 (leveraging open
           source codecs)

|

Encoder and Decoder Capabilities
================================

Max capabilites of the drivers seen in |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| are as follows:

   - ENCODER: 2 x 1080p30 streams running in parallel
   - DECODER : 8 x 1080p30 streams running in parallel

ENCODER does not support resolutions greater than 1080p due to hardware limitations.
No more than 2 channels can be processed in parallel. Higher framerates are supported
for 1080p when only 1 channel is in use as it will split the load across both the hardware
pipes. Max framerate for a single 1080p channel is 60fps.

4k decoding is supported by the DECODER. However, 8 channels, which represent maximum
number of pipes on the device, do not have the capability of doing 4k simultaneously.

|

Demos
=====

The multimedia video decode capabilities can be demonstrated by using
the GStreamer pipeline to decode to the display. Please refer to the section
`GStreamer Pipelines`_  for further details.

Software Architecture
=====================

Software Stack of Accelerated Codec Encoding/Decoding
-----------------------------------------------------

As shown in the figures below, the software stack of the accelerated
encoding and decoding has two parts:

   - A V4L2 (Video4Linux version 2) software driver running as part of Linux on
     the A72 MPU subsystem

   - The firmware running on the DECODER and ENCODER

The driver communicates with the firmware running on the ENCODER/DECODER
through its own IPC (inter-processor communication).
At the highest level in the MPU subsystem on the A72, |__SDK_FULL_NAME__|
comes packaged with Gstreamer. GStreamer is an open source framework that
simplifies the development of multimedia applications. This application is
responsible for abstracting away details specific to the hardware acceleators.
The accelerators are reference in Gstreamer by the V4L2 plugin. This plugin is
responsible for the interaction between user space and the V4L2 kernel driver.

Linux Kernel Drivers
--------------------

.. rubric:: TI-Provided V4L2 Drivers for Multimedia
   :name: ti-provided-v4l2-drivers-for-multimedia

Video4Linux version 2 (V4L2) is an open source framework that
provides a media interface to all Linux-based applications. V4L2 is
a collection of device drivers and an API for supporting realtime
video capture and video memory-to-memory operations on Linux systems.

Video encode and decode using the ENCODER and DECODER hardware, respectively,
are enabled as V4L2 drivers. The V4L2 is integrated with the ENCODER and
DECODER drivers by a thin layer that implements the required V4L2 ioctls.
Furthermore, this layer is also responsible for translating the incoming
V4L2 data structures to those understood by the ENCODER/DECODER.

V4L2 Video Decoder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The V4L2 video decoder driver is a memory-to-memory device that receives
the encoded data on its "output" stream and generates the decoded data to
its "capture" stream. The module name is "vxd-dec.ko".

.. rubric:: Codec Support
   :name: v4l2-dec-codec-support

The V4L2 decoder driver supports receiving the following encoded bitstream
formats on its "output" stream:

        -  V4L2_PIX_FMT_H264
        -  V4L2_PIX_FMT_HEVC
        -  V4L2_PIX_FMT_MJPEG

.. rubric:: Color Format Support
   :name: v4l2-dec-color-format-support

The DECODER supports outputting several color formats. There is no color
conversion performed. The selected color format should be the same as the
native color format of the encoded stream. The V4L2 decoder driver supports
several standard V4L2 color formats, plus two custom color formats. The
formats supported are:

Standard Formats:

        -  V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12
        -  V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV16
        -  V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV420M
        -  V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV422M

Custom Formats:

        - V4L2_PIX_FMT_TI1210 (NV12 10-bit)
        - V4L2_PIX_FMT_TI1610 (NV16 10-bit)

.. note::
    Formats with an "M" at the end of their name are multi-planar formats,
    meaning that the planes are non-contiguous in memory.

The following table shows the native color format support for each of the supported codecs:

+--------------+------------------------------+
| **Codec**    | **Supported Color Format**   |
+--------------+------------------------------+
| H.264        | V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12            |

|              |                              |
|              | V4L2_PIX_FMT_TI1610          |
+--------------+------------------------------+
| MJPEG        | V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV420M         |
|              |                              |
|              | V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV422M         |
+--------------+------------------------------+


V4L2 Video Encoder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The V4L2 video encoder driver is a memory-to-memory device that receives
the raw frame data on its "output" stream and generates the encoded data to
its "capture" stream. The module name is "vxe-enc.ko".

.. rubric:: Codec Support
   :name: v4l2-enc-codec-support

The V4L2 encoder driver supports encoding to the following encoded bitstream
formats on its "capture" stream:

        -  V4L2_PIX_FMT_H264

.. rubric:: Color Format Support
   :name: v4l2-enc-color-format-support

The V4L2 encoder driver supports encoding of the following color formats for
the raw data "output" stream:

        -  V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12

.. rubric:: Configurable Controls
   :name: v4l2-enc-config-controls

The V4L2 encoder driver has the following configurable controls:

+-------------------------------------+---------+-------------+----------+--------------+
| **Ctrl**                            | **Min** | **Max**     | **Step** | **Default**  |
+-------------------------------------+---------+-------------+----------+--------------+
| V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_GOP_SIZE        |      1  |       7200  |       1  |        1800  |
+-------------------------------------+---------+-------------+----------+--------------+
| V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_BITRATE         |  50000  |  100000000  |       1  |      500000  |
+-------------------------------------+---------+-------------+----------+--------------+

+-------------------------------------+---------+-------------+----------+--------------+

.. note::

   The controls should be set before calling VIDIOC_S_FMT.

The following table gives recommended values for bitrate based on resolution and frame type:

+---------------------+---------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| **Resolution**      | **Bitrate for I-frame Only sequence** | **Bitrate for IPP sequence** |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| QCIF (176x144)      |                   1000000             |             500000           |

+---------------------+---------------------------------------+------------------------------+

The encoder driver is using standard v4l2 mechanisms for configuring the various parameters
for profile, level, bitrate, tools, gop structure, etc. This means the user can use 'v4l2-ctl -L'
to list all the available controls.  Then from gstreamer, use the extra-controls=s,<ctrl_name>=<value>
syntax to actually set them as part of the v4l2h264enc parameters.

However, it is important to note that while profile and level can be set using
this method, GStreamer 1.20.5 always sets profile and level to baseline/level_1.

To overcome this, don't set profile/level with extra-controls, use the caps
of the video stream to set profile and level like this between the encoder and the next element.

.. code-block:: text

      ! 'video/x-h264,profile=(string)main,level=(string)4.0'  !

Please see section `Running a GStreamer pipeline`_ for example pipelines that properly
set the additional controls in Gstreamer.


GStreamer Plugins for Multimedia
--------------------------------

.. rubric:: Open Source GStreamer Overview
   :name: open-source-gstreamer-overview

GStreamer is an open source framework that simplifies the development of
multimedia applications, such as media players and capture encoders. It
encapsulates existing multimedia software components, such as codecs,
filters, and platform-specific I/O operations, by using a standard
interface and providing a uniform framework across applications.

The modular nature of GStreamer facilitates the addition of new
functionality, transparent inclusion of component advancements and
allows for flexibility in application development and testing.
Processing nodes are implemented via GStreamer plugins with several sink
and/or source pads. Many plugins are running as ARM software
implementations, but for more complex SoCs, certain functions are better
executed on hardware-accelerated IPs like D5520MP2 (DECODER) and
VXE384MP2 (ENCODER).

GStreamer is a multimedia framework based on data flow paradigm. It allows
easy plugin registration just by deploying new shared objects to the
/usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0 folder. The shared libraries in this folder are
scanned for reserved data structures identifying capabilities of
individual plugins. Individual processing nodes can be interconnected as
a pipeline at run-time, creating complex topologies. Node interfacing
compatibility is verified before the pipeline is started.

GStreamer brings a lot of value-added features to |__SDK_FULL_NAME__|,
including audio encoding/decoding, audio/video synchronization, and
interaction with a wide variety of open source plugins (muxers,
demuxers, codecs, and filters). New GStreamer features are continuously
being added, and the core libraries are actively supported by
participants in the GStreamer community. Additional information about
the GStreamer framework is available on the GStreamer project site:
http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/.

.. rubric:: Hardware-Accelerated GStreamer Plugins
   :name: video-decode-gstreamer-plugins

One benefit of using GStreamer as a multimedia framework is that the
core libraries already build and run on ARM Linux. Only a GStreamer
plugin is required to enable additional hardware features on TI's
embedded processors with both ARM and hardware accelerators for
multimedia. The open source GStreamer plugins provide elements for
GStreamer pipelines that enable the use of hardware-accelerated video
decoding through the V4L2 GStreamer plugin.

Below is a list of GStreamer plugins that utilize the hardware-accelerated
video decoding in the |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__|.

-  DECODER

        #. v4l2h264dec
        #. v4l2h265dec
        #. v4l2jpegdec

-  ENCODER

        #. v4l2h264enc

GStreamer Pipelines
===================

.. rubric:: Visual Representation of Typical GStreamer Pipelines
   :name: visual-representation-of-typical-gstreamer-pipelines

A typical GStreamer pipeline starts with one or more source elements,
uses zero or more filter elements, and ends in a sink or multiple sinks.

This section provides visual representation of one typical GStreamer
pipeline: multimedia decoding and playout.

.. rubric:: Decode Pipeline
   :name: decode-pipeline

The example pipeline shown in the figure :ref:`gst-dec-playout-fig`
demonstrates the demuxing and playback of a transport stream. The input
is first read using the source element, and then processed by
GStreamer playbin2 (Player Bin 2). To use playbin2 in the pipeline,
we use the playbin element (as shown in the figure below). Inside playbin2,
demuxer first demuxes the stream into its audio and video stream components.

The video stream is then queued and sent to V4L2
GStreamer plugin for decoding. Finally, it is sent to a video sink to
display the decoded video on the screen. The audio stream is queued and
then decoded by the ARM audio GStreamer plugin, and then reaches its
destination at the alsasink element to play the decoded audio.

Running a GStreamer pipeline
----------------------------

GStreamer pipelines can also run from the command line. In order to do so,
exit Weston by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Backspace from the keyboard which
connects to the EVM. Then, if the LCD screen stays in "Please wait...",
press Ctrl-Alt-F1 to go to the command line on the LCD console. After that,
the command line can be used from serial console, SSH console, or LCD
console.

One can run an audio video file using the GStreamer playbin from the
console. Currently, the supported Audio/video sink is kmssink,
waylandsink and alsassink.

.. note::
   playbin is currently supported only with kmssink and only for NV12 output.

.. code-block:: text

    kmssink:
      target #  gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=file:///<path_to_file> video-sink=kmssink audio-sink=alsasink

One can also run an audio video file without playbin. This is required
for decode to any sink except kmssink due to the need to use the video
format filter, which can not be used with playbin. The following pipelines
show how to playback to kmssink and waylandsink without playbin.

.. code-block:: text

    kmssink (video only playback):
      target #  gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/<path_to_file> ! qtdemux ! h264parse ! v4l2h264dec ! video/x-raw,format=NV12 ! kmssink

.. code-block:: text

    kmssink (audio + video playback):
      target #  gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/<path_to_file> ! qtdemux name=demux \
                demux.video_0 ! queue ! h264parse ! v4l2h264dec ! video/x-raw,format=NV12 ! kmssink \
                demux.audio_0 ! queue ! decodebin ! alsasink

The following pipelines show playback to waylandsink. Please refer
:doc:`Foundational_Components/Graphics/index`
to start Weston before running the pipelines.

.. code-block:: text

    waylandsink (video only playback):
      target #  gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/<path_to_file> ! qtdemux ! h264parse ! v4l2h264dec ! video/x-raw,format=NV12 ! waylandsink

.. code-block:: text

    waylandsink (audio + video playback):
      target #  gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/<path_to_file> ! qtdemux name=demux \
                demux.video_0 ! queue ! h264parse ! v4l2h264dec ! video/x-raw,format=NV12 ! waylandsink \
                demux.audio_0 ! queue ! decodebin ! alsasink

.. note::
   #.  The V4L2 Plugin (and TI V4L2 Video Decode driver) will not select the
       native color format on its own. The video format filter MUST be used to
       ensure proper decoding. The required filter is highlighted in the below
       example pipeline. The format can be changed according to the input stream:

        gst-launch-1.0 ! filesrc location=/<path_to_file> ! qtdemux ! h264parse ! v4l2h264dec ! **video/x-raw,format=NV12** ! waylandsink

   #.  If the native format is not supported by the sink, then a color converter
       plugin will need to be used in the pipeline.
   #.  playbin is currently supported ONLY with kmssink and ONLY for NV12 format.

   For full list of limitations, see `Limitations of GStreamer Plugins`_.

The following pipelines show examples of using the v4l2h265dec and v4l2jpegdec elements.

.. code-block:: text

    HEVC/H.265 video playback to waylandsink
      target #  gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/<path_to_file> ! qtdemux ! h265parse ! v4l2h265dec ! video/x-raw,format=NV12 ! waylandsink

.. code-block:: text

    MJPEG video playback to waylandsink
      target #  gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/<path_to_file> ! qtdemux ! jpegparse ! v4l2jpegdec ! video/x-raw,format=I420 ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=NV12 ! waylandsink

Scaling of the decoded video to fit the display with kmssink can be achieved by
selecting a kms plane with scaling support.

.. code-block:: text

    To enumerate all the connector IDs and plane IDs, modetest can be used:
      target #  modetest -M tidss -p

    kmssink playback using VID plane that supports display scaling:
      target #  gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=file:///<path_to_file> video-sink="kmssink plane-id=41" audio-sink=alsasink

    Or
      target #  gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/<path_to_file> ! qtdemux ! h264parse ! v4l2h264dec ! video/x-raw,format=NV12 ! kmssink plane-id=41

The following pipeline shows example of using the v4l2h264enc element.

.. code-block:: text

   H.264 video encoding to filesink
      target #  gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/<path_to_file> rawvideoparse width=1280 height=720 framerate=30/1 format=23 ! v4l2h264enc ! filesink location=/<path_to_file>

As previously mentioned in `Linux Kernel Drivers`_, the encoder can be configured with additional controls. The following
pipelines provided some insight on how these configurations can be done.

.. code-block:: text

   Main Profile, level 4, and CABAC disabled
      target # gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc num_buffers=1000 ! capssetter caps="video/x-raw,width=1920,height=1072,framerate=25/1,format=NV12" ! \
               v4l2h264enc extra-controls="s,video_bitrate=1000000,h264_8x8_transform_enable=false,\
               h264_entropy_mode=false,max_number_of_reference_pics=1" ! \
               'video/x-h264,profile=(string)main,level=(string)4' ! filesink location=test.264

.. code-block:: text

   High profile, level 5.1, with CABAC and 8x8 transform enabled
      target # gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc num_buffers=1000 ! capssetter caps="video/x-raw,width=1920,height=1072,framerate=25/1,format=NV12" ! \
               v4l2h264enc extra-controls="s,video_bitrate=1000000,h264_8x8_transform_enable=true,\
               h264_entropy_mode=true,max_number_of_reference_pics=1" ! 'video/x-h264,profile=(string)main,level=(string)5.1' ! filesink location=test.264

.. code-block:: text

   Constrained baseline, level 2.1
      target # gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc num_buffers=1000 ! capssetter caps="video/x-raw,width=320,height=240,framerate=20/1,format=NV12" ! \
               v4l2h264enc extra-controls="s,video_bitrate=64000,h264_8x8_transform_enable=false, h264_entropy_mode=0,max_number_of_reference_pics=1" ! \
               'video/x-h264,profile=(string)baseline,level=(string)2.1' ! filesink location=test.264

.. note::
   If an incorrect combination of tools is used, or a bitrate/num_ref_frames
   more than the requested level can support, then the driver WILL override
   the configuration that was scpecified. By specifying these settings, the user is
   hinting to the driver what is desired, but the driver inevitably makes the final
   decision.

Furthermore, controls have been added to give the user the ability to customize the memory configuration in the driver. The default
configuration is to adhere to the H.264 spec while simultaneously achieving max performance as per IMG hardware. However,
not every stream will need to use the same amount of Decoded Picture Buffers (DPB) - buffers that are used to hold the output
from a video decode operation. Buffers found in the DPB list are used for reference for future frames. The stream in use
may be configured in a way that only one reference frame is needed. In this case, the default configuration is using more memory
than necessary.

To revert the driver back to previous version that only uses 1 reference frame, see below gstreamer pipeline. This pipeline will
result in the driver communicating to the firmware that only 1 reference frame should be retained during decode proces. 

.. code-block:: text

   Use 1 Reference Frame for Decode
   target # gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=<filename.264> ! h264parse ! v4l2h264dec extra-controls=”s,max_dec_frame_buffering=1” ! waylandsink

.. note:: 
   This might decrease the display latency if the stream does not depend on more than a single reference frame, 
   but it will make the driver less compliant with the H.264 specification.

The algorithm to calculate the number of buffers is now as follows.

.. code-block:: text

   num_ref_frames + ((num_cores * slots_per_core) - 1) + display_pipeline_length

.. note::
   num_cores and slots_per_core are constants set in the driver that correspond to the hardware pipelines on the DECODER. These values 
   can be changed, but it is not recommened as it could lead to performance issues.

The driver now allows for complete configuration of this algorithm by exposing these four new controls to the user.

   max_dec_frame_buffering:   min=0 max=16 step=1 default=0 value=0
   display_pipeline_size:     min=0 max=6 step=1 default=3 value=3
   img_extra_decode_buffers:  min=-1 max=3 step=1 default=-1 value=-1
   override_spec_dpb_buffers: min=-1 max=16 step=1 default=-1 value=-1

.. note::
   The combination of override_spec_dpb_buffers + img_extra_decode_buffers + display_pipeline_length will translate to the total
   number of buffer used by the driver to perform decode.

If override_spec_dpb_buffers is set to -1, then the driver will base the number of DPBs using the algorithm supplied in the 
H.264 specification based on profile and level. Setting img_extra_decode_buffers will overwrite the ((num_cores * slots_per_core) - 1) 
portion of buffer allocation algorithm.

The following pipelines highlight how these controls can be used to control memory allocation in the driver.

.. code-block:: text

   Remove additional buffers allocated due to cores present on DECODER
   target # gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=<filename.264> ! h264parse ! v4l2h264dec 
   extra-controls=”s,max_dec_frame_buffering=0,display_pipeline_size=2,img_extra_decode_buffers=0” ! waylandsink

.. code-block:: text

   Hardcode number of reference frames used
   target # gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=<filename.264> ! h264parse ! v4l2h264dec 
   extra-controls=”s,max_dec_frame_buffering=0,display_pipeline_size=2,img_extra_decode_buffers=0, override_spec_dpb_buffers=2” ! kmssink

.. note::
   Keep in mind that while this allows for complete control, it is important to understand that changing these values can negatively impact decode
   performance while reducing memory consumption. It is best to trial different configurations and select what is best for the use case if reducing
   memory consumption is desired.


All external controls supported by Encoder and Decoder can be seen using below command.

.. code-block:: text

   Encoder: v4l2-ctl -d 1 -l
   Decoder: v4l2-ctl -d 0 -l

Limitations of GStreamer Plugins
--------------------------------

.. rubric:: Limitations of GStreamer Plugins
   :name: gstreamer-plugins-limitations

* GStreamer V4L2 plugin decoder elements need video filter
  (video/x-raw,format=<format>) to select the native color format for decoding.
* playbin is supported ONLY with kmssink and ONLY with NV12 format due to need
  for video filter with other sinks.

|

GStreamer Plugin Internals
--------------------------

.. rubric:: V4L2 GStreamer Plugin Support
   :name: v4l2-gstreamer-plugin-support

Each V4L2 decode element has one sink pad and one src pad. The sink pad
is for receiving the encoded bitstream, and the src pad is for outputting the
raw video data.

.. rubric:: Element Src and Sink Pads
   :name: element-src-and-sink-pads

The following table gives the format support for the sink and src pads for each
supported element.

+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| **Element**                | **Sink Pad Format**        | **Src Pad Format**         |
+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+

.. note::
   #.  No color conversion is performed in the plugin or V4L2 drivers. The
       color format selected should be that of the native color format of the encoded bitstream.
   #.  To select the appropriate color format, it is important to provide the color
       format filter to the GStreamer pipeline. See `Running a GStreamer pipeline`_ for more
       information on how to provide this filter. Example:

        gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=<file_location> ! h264parse ! v4l2h264dec ! **video/x-raw,format=NV12** ! kmssink

   #.  The v4l2 decode driver supports some
       `custom 10-bit color formats <Foundational_Components_Multimedia_D5520_VXE384.html#v4l2-dec-color-format-support>`__,
       but that support is not available at GStreamer plugin side.

   For full list of limitations, see `Limitations of GStreamer Plugins`_.

.. rubric:: Inspecting an Element
   :name: inspecting-an-element

To get the full information about an element, the gst-inspect-1.0 utility can be used on
the target. For example:

.. code-block:: text

    target #  gst-inspect-1.0 v4l2h264dec
    target #  gst-inspect-1.0 v4l2h264enc

.. note::
   gst-inspect-1.0 will show that all color formats are available for every element.
   However, not all color formats are supported by every element. The table
   `here <Foundational_Components_Multimedia_D5520_VXE384.html#element-src-and-sink-pads>`__
   summarizes the actual support per element.

.. rubric:: Buffer Flow Considerations
   :name: buffer-flow-considerations

The V4L2 GStreamer Plugin provides the ability to either allocate its own buffers,
or import buffers from a downstream plugin such as kmssink or waylandsink. This
buffer io-mode can be selected using the property "capture-io-mode". To request
the decoder element (and in turn the TI V4L2 decoder driver) to do the allocation,
"dmabuf" (GST_V4L2_IO_DMABUF) is used. To request the element to import buffers
allocated downstream, "dmabuf-import" (GST_V4L2_IO_DMABUF_IMPORT) is used. By
default for the decode elements, GST_V4L2_IO_DMABUF will be selected due to V4L2
decoder driver support for it. An example of using dmabuf-import in a gstreamer
pipeline:

.. code-block:: text

   gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=<file_location> ! h264parse ! v4l2h264dec capture-io-mode=5 ! kmssink driver-name=tidss

With the TI V4L2 Video Decoder Driver, the best latency performance to display is achieved
with "dmabuf-import" (GST_V4L2_IO_DMABUF_IMPORT). This feature provides
the best performance because internally the V4L2 element will no longer
have to copy buffer information the element's region, to the display region.

Memory Optimisation
===================

Decoder Driver Memory Optimisation
----------------------------------

   To optimise the Decoder driver memory allocation with performance degradation less than 10%.
   Change the Macro in Makefile as CAPTURE_CONTIG_ALLOC ?=n, and follow the driver rebuild instructions.

   .. code-block:: text

       drivers/media/platform/vxe-vxd/makefile

   Make the following change:

   .. code-block:: text

       -                 CAPTURE_CONTIG_ALLOC ?=y
       +                 CAPTURE_CONTIG_ALLOC ?=n

   By changing this macro, the memory allocation is switching from using CMA (contiguous memory allocation)
   to taking advantage of the MMU that is packaged on the DECODER.

|

Rebuilding and Debugging
========================

Rebuilding V4L2 Drivers
-----------------------

If any modification are made to the drivers, they will need to be rebuilt
and updated on the device. These drivers are rebuilt by following the standard
process for `Building TI's Linux Kernel <Foundational_Components_Kernel_Users_Guide.html>`__.
Please refer to this page for a more detailed guide in rebuilding modules.

Once built, install the rebuilt module(s) on target filesystem. Copy the new kernel
modules to their proper location on board. These locations for decoder and encoder,
respectively, can be seen below.

        -  /lib/modules/<version>/kernel/drivers/media/platform/vxe-vxd/vxd-dec.ko
        -  /lib/modules/<version>/kernel/drivers/media/platform/vxe-vxd/vxe-enc.ko

Debug Logs
----------

In case additional logs are needed from the V4L2 Encode or Decode
drivers, debug tracing can be enabled by rebuilding the module
with the appropriate options selected.

.. rubric:: V4L2 Decoder Debug Options
   :name: v4l2-dec-debug-options

DEBUG_DECODER_DRIVER can be set to 'y' to enable all the debug tracing
in the decoder driver. This should only be used for debugging
purposes. To enable it, set DEBUG_DECODER_DRIVER to 'y' and rebuild
the decoder module following the instructions in `Rebuilding V4L2 Drivers`_.

.. rubric:: V4L2 Encoder Debug Options
   :name: v4l2-enc-debug-options

DEBUG_ENCODER_DRIVER can be set to 'y' to enable all the debug tracing
in the encoder driver. This should only be used for debugging
purposes. To enable it, set DEBUG_ENCODER_DRIVER to 'y' and rebuild
the encoder module following the instructions in `Rebuilding V4L2 Drivers`_.

Latency Profiling
-----------------

The decode latency of the V4L2 Decoder can be measured at the picture or
firmware level. Only one can be enabled at a time.

.. rubric:: Decoder Firmware Latency Profiling
   :name: decoder-firmware-latency-profiling

To enable firmware latency profiling, follow these steps:

#. Enable the print in the driver code by modifying the following file:

   .. code-block:: text

       drivers/media/platform/img/vxe-vxd/decoder/vxd_pvdec.c

   Make the following change:

   .. code-block:: text

       -                 dev_info(dev,
       +                 dev_err(dev,
                                  "fw decode time is %llu us for msg_id x%0x\n",

#. Follow the instructions in the section `Rebuilding V4L2 Drivers`_ in
   order to rebuild the module and copy the updated module to the target.
   The module to copy is vxd-dec.ko.
#. Collect the logs and look for the traces that look like:

   .. code-block:: text

       [  802.626314] img_dec 4300000.video-decoder: fw decode time is 5314 us for msg_id xc60f

#. Each trace gives the firmware decode time per frame. All numbers are in
   micro seconds.

.. rubric:: Decoder V4L2-level Picture Decode Latency Profiling
   :name: decoder-v4l2-picture-dec-latency-profiling

To enable V4L2-level picture decode latency profiling, follow these steps:

#. Enable the print in the driver code by modifying the following file:

   .. code-block:: text

       drivers/media/platform/img/vxe-vxd/decoder/vxd_v4l2.c

   Make the following change:

   .. code-block:: text

       -                 dev_info(dev,
       +                 dev_err(dev,
                                 "picture buf decode time is %llu us for buf_map_id 0x%x\n",

#. Follow the instructions in the section `Rebuilding V4L2 Drivers`_ in
   order to rebuild the module and copy the updated module to the target.
   The module to copy is vxd-dec.ko.
#. Collect the logs and look for the traces that look like:

   .. code-block:: text

       [  511.316237] img_dec 4300000.video-decoder: picture buf decode time is 9901 us for buf_map_id 0x4000025

#. Each trace gives the v4l2-level picture decode time per frame. All numbers are in
   micro seconds.

.. note::
   Known limitations:
      #. DMA Buf import on encoder works only for 16 byte width and height aligned buffers from the upstream element.
         For Non 16 byte aligned resolution, the pipeline exits safely with buffer size negotiation error.
